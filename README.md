# Unity Showcase
A simple web application that displays a random game from this [Unity Gallery](https://unity3d.com/showcase/gallery/)  
This application was written in python 2 using the flask web framework. The application will display a
different game from the gallery every time you refresh the page and will not repeat a game until you have
visited each game once.
